# For both prototypes

* no indication for the email whether it had been replied to or not
* inability to send an email directly from both the contact section and a contact profile
* no sorting for the contacts
* experts had problems with creating a new event on a specific date (even though it was set to double-click in one of the prototypes)
* inconsistent date format in different sections of the prototypes
* missing site name/ logo in system

# For Prototype #2​ (HTML/ CSS/ Bootstrap ​http://basicbits.de/prototype_abe/login.html)​ 

* system’s name in the left top corner is not linked to the inbox
* no add recipient option in create email form
* same style and close position for save, discard, sent buttons in create email
* unconventional reply screen

# Hypothesis 

Having Settings link as part of the navigation bar is more convenient for the user than having it as part of a submenu.
 - The experts state that it should be at the top as a part of the navigation bar. They are in disagreement if it should always be visible or part of a submenu.

Headlines with the current site title and highlighting are supporting the general orientation on the website more than only highlighting of the current navigational position.


The position of the search field in the top left corner / top navigation bar leads to easier navigation compared to having the search field within the main context of the view.
